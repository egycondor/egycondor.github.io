# 🗺️ About Me

Welcome to my space on the web! I'm **Egycondor**, a security consultant with a passion for cracking codes, unmasking vulnerabilities, and weaving a blanket of protection around digital infrastructures.

## 🏜️ Born in the Land of Pharaohs

I hail from the enigmatic Giza, also famously known as the Pyramids City. Growing up in the shadow of the iconic pyramids, I've always been intrigued by puzzles, mysteries, and the unknown. It's no wonder I was drawn towards the dynamic world of cybersecurity.

## 🔐 A Life Beyond Codes

Apart from my professional life, I am an avid Capture The Flag (CTF) player and maker. Delving into CTF challenges has not only refined my skills but has also given me a platform to engage with a community that shares my zeal for cybersecurity.

## 🎮 Gamer at Heart

When I'm not buried in codes or crafting challenges, you'll find me immersed in the world of gaming. It's more than just a hobby – it's an alternate reality where I explore, challenge, and escape.

## 💌 Let's Connect!

If you're as passionate about cybersecurity, CTFs, or gaming as I am, I'd love to connect. Whether you're seeking advice, collaboration, or just a chat about the latest game release, drop me a line.

Thanks for visiting.
